SoundCloud Audio Uploader for Artists and Record Labels


Scaup uploads an entire directory of audio files as a 'set' (called 'playlist' in the SoundCloud user interface), and also uploads album art and track metadata.

Since the SoundCloud terms of service only allow applications to authenticate with a password if it's your own account,
you have to register an app yourself and stick the app 'key' and 'secret' into the configuration file before you can use it.
